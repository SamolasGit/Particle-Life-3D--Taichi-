Particle Life 3D is a **GPU-accelerated 3D particle simulation** built with **Taichi**, combining multiple particle-based interaction models into a single **emergent system**.

Particles are divided into distinct **species** that **attract or repel** each other according to a randomized interaction matrix. When particles come into close contact, they can **react**, transforming into new species and dynamically altering the system’s behavior over time.

The simulation runs entirely on the **GPU** and features a **real-time 3D camera** with interactive controls, allowing live exploration and tuning of the simulation parameters.
